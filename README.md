# Goal Recognition in FOND Planning Domain Models with LTLf and PLTL Goals

In this project, we develop goal recognition approaches that are capable to recognize LTLf and PLTL goals in fully observable non-deterministic domain models.
Our approaches use off-the-shelf FOND planners.

## Prerequisites

This project is based on the following libraries:

- [FOND4LTLfPLTLf](https://github.com/whitemech/FOND4LTLfPLTLf)
- [PRP Planner](https://github.com/QuMuLab/planner-for-relevant-policies)
